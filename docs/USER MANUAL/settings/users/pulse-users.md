When procurred with an application, Redfast will set up an admin user account(s) for your team to access the Pulse app. Usually, the first account is created with a **Company admin** or **App admin** permission level. Only Company and App admins can modify settings and invite new users.

## Permission levels

### Company admin

**Company admins** can **create and change** all of a specific company's apps and add new apps (i.e., staging environment app) within the same company.

### App admin

**App admins** have the same ability to alter app settings as company admins, but only for a specific app and cannot create new apps. If you'd like your staging and production apps to have different admins, you should set the company settings to **Member** and the corresponding app settings to **Admin**.

### App Member

**App Members** can see the dashboard and modify prompts and segments, but they cannot edit the app "Settings" section.

### Read only

**Read only** users can view the dashboard but cannot modify any of the prompt/app settings.
