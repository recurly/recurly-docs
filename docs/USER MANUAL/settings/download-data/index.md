Redfast can export data to various external systems. The simplest option is a CSV export of Segment, Prompt, and Guide data.

More advanced options to receive event data and syncing with an external reporting system like Google Analytics are also possible.

# Download from Pulse

See this [article](/docs/can-i-download-prompt-interactions-data#detailed-activity-data) for instructions on how to download activity data directly from Pulse.

# Download from AWS S3

Data from all user activity relating to running prompts are continuously saved to an AWS S3 bucket. This data may be imported into your BI system for offline analysis.

1. Go to Settings &gt; User Traits
2. Select “Click here for AWS S3 credentials”

3. You will need to copy the AWS Bucket, Access Key and Secret Key to login. Replace `ingest` with `exports` within the Upload Location path. All filenames will start with the activities prefix.
