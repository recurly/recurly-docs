Redfast pipelines is a unique way to manage your users across various lifecycle stages. It is also a way to create and reinforce positive behavior loops with your audience.

### Lifecycle

Redfast provides three lifecycle-based pipelines:

* Member pipeline: This pipeline segments active users into five stages.
  * Anonymous: Visitors to your marketing landing pages.
  * Trial: Users in the trial phase of their subscription.
  * Monthly: Users on the monthly plan.
  * Premium: Users on the premium plan.
  * Pending Cancel: Users that have canceled their subscription but continue to have access.
  * Cancelled: Users that have churned.
* Engagement pipeline: This pipeline segments active users into the following stages:
  * New users
  * Repeat users
  * Regular users
  * Frequent users
  * Heavy users  
    Each stage's default settings can be modified to match your organization's definitions.
* E-commerce pipeline: 
  * Visitor: Users that have not yet commenced checkout
  * Shopper: Users with an item added to their cart
  * Checkout: Users in the checkout process
  * Customer: Users that have completed checkout

Each stage of every pipeline automatically further segments the users into:

* Engaged: users whose visits and minutes are on an increasing trajectory
* At Risk: users whose visits and minutes are on a decreasing trajectory
* Everyone else

### Behavior

Custom pipelines can be used to reinforce LTV-enhancing usage patterns. For example, if your analytics suggest that users who watch more episodic content have a higher LTV, you can set a 'Watch more episodic content' pipeline comprised of the following stages:

* Users who have watched one episode
* Users who have watched two episodes
* Users who have watched three or more episodes

### Moving users from one stage to the next

While a pipeline can give you a bird's-eye view of your active users, it can also be an invaluable tool for moving users from one stage to the next.

For example, you can encourage engaged trial users to become members before their trial ends with a prompt that provides a one-time offer to a membership plan. Click on Add Prompt on the stage to select a prompt style for your prompt

Next, specify the sub-segments of users within this stage that will see the prompt as well as the goal for this prompt as shown below.

The remaining steps are identical to those for [creating a prompt](prompts).
