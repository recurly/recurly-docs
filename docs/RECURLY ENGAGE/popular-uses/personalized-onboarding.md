Traditional approaches to onboarding new users include a step-by-step home page tour with highlighted callouts to various features. This method is relevant for B2B sites or apps, but B2C service users find it annoying as it impedes their flow. 

Redfast's Journey guide is a breakthrough new approach to onboarding users in a personalized and contextual manner. Here is how it works.

Even before a new user arrives on the site, a Redfast guide is configured with links to the key elements of the site and the order in which they should be presented to the end user. Further, the elements are only shown to the user if they have not visited that section or performed the desired action. Lastly, the prompts in this guide can be configured to be shown over multiple visits. All of this produces a much more user-friendly approach to the challenge of educating and informing new users.
