Most subscription businesses use outbound email campaigns to inform users about premium plans and add-ons. While this can work with your highly engaged users, your casual users require context to establish relevance for why they should make this purchase.

Redfast provides a highly personalized approach to getting your users to purchase add-ons and premium plans. By targeting users on the site who have not purchased the add-on or the premium plan with a prompt, you can provide the user with greater context. You can further increase the context by creating a trigger based on a screen or event on the site that can be used to show the prompt.
