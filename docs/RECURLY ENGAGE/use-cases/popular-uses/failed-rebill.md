A common problem with subscription businesses is when an attempt to bill the customer fails. This can happen due to various reasons such as expired cards, fraud, or spending limits. While your payment processor may offer some black box processes to remedy this issue, only a tiny percentage are recovered using this approach.

Redfast provides an additional tool to reduce involuntary churn by using a guide to prompt the user over one or more visits to update their payment information.

> 📘 Make sure you check the 'Sync events' option, if available, for your billing platform under Settings > Actions. This ensures that updates from dunning processes are synced with the Redfast segments.
