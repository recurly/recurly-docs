  <summary>Cancelled Subscriptions (ending)</summary>

  The number of subscriptions at the end of the month that have been cancelled by the customer or by the merchant by clicking on “cancel subscription” in the Recurly Commerce portal/merchant admin.

<details>
  <summary>Paused Subscriptions (ending)</summary>

  The number of subscriptions at the end of the month that are in a paused state. Depending on your store configuration, customers may have paused for an indefinite period of time (only will unpause if an action to unpause is taken), or for a specific period of time (i.e 3 renewals), at which point they will automatically unpause. See Customer Portal tab to configure your pause settings.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Failed/Dunning Subscriptions (ending)</summary>

  The number of subscriptions at the end of the month that are in a failed state and are going through active dunning management.
