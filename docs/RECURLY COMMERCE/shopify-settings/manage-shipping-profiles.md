# Overview

### Prerequisites & limitations

* Requires Shopify shipping profiles to be properly configured under **Settings → Shipping and delivery**.
* If your Shopify profile already covers subscriptions, **do not** enable free shipping in Recurly Commerce to avoid rule conflicts.

# Definition

Managing shipping profiles means using Shopify’s built-in shipping settings to determine which countries, order values, or quantities qualify for free shipping on subscription orders.

# Key benefits

* **Zero duplication of work**: Use the same shipping profiles you’ve already set up in Shopify—no separate configuration in Recurly Commerce.
* **Granular control**: Specify countries, minimum purchase amounts, or quantity thresholds for free shipping on subscription renewals.
* **Flexible application**: Choose whether free shipping applies to every renewal or only the first N orders.

# Key details

## Viewing your Shopify shipping profiles

Recurly Commerce does not host shipping rules itself—it reads from Shopify. To view or edit your profiles:

1. In Shopify admin, go to **Settings** → **Shipping and delivery**.
2. Locate the profile you want to use for subscriptions.

> **Note:** If a Shopify profile already applies to subscription orders, skip the free-shipping setup in Recurly Commerce to prevent overlapping rules.

## Configuring free shipping in Recurly Commerce

1. In the Recurly Commerce app, navigate to **Subscription Plans**, then select **Edit** on your plan and scroll to **Free Shipping**.
2. Toggle **Free Shipping** on.
3. Set your parameters:

   * **Countries**: Which regions qualify.
   * **Minimum order amount** or **quantity**: The spend or item count threshold.
   * **Applies to**: Choose **All renewals** or **First N orders only**.

> **Note**: Only enable if you need different shipping rules for subscriptions than your standard Shopify profile.
