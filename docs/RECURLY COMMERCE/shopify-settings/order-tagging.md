# Definition

Order tagging is the automatic assignment of Shopify tags to subscription orders, letting you differentiate, filter, and report on them with precision.

# Key benefits

* **Clear differentiation**: Tags mark subscription purchases so you can instantly distinguish them from one-time orders.
* **Powerful filtering**: Leverage Shopify’s tag filters to segment and search your order history.
* **Analytics-ready**: Use tags in your reports, dashboards, or integrations for deeper insights.

## Subscription tag types

Recurly Commerce applies these five standard tags to subscription orders:

| Tag                              | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Subscription order**           | Applied to every subscription order—use it to separate subscription orders from one-time purchases.                                             |
| **Subscription order \<number>** | Sequential tag per subscription: initial purchase is “Subscription order 1,” renewals increment the number (e.g. “Subscription order 2,” etc.). |
| **First time subscriber**        | Marks a customer’s very first subscription order. (Migrated subscribers will not receive this tag.)                                             |
| **Recurring subscription order** | Applied to all renewal orders after the first—signifies returning subscribers.                                                                  |
| **Shipping Profile**             | Reflects the Shopify shipping profile selected for that order (e.g., economy, free shipping), enabling fulfillment or reporting logic.          |
| **Gift subscription order**      | When the order is a gifted subscription, initial and recurring orders will have this tag.                                                       |
| **Prepaid subscription order**   | If the contract is a prepaid contract initial and recurring orders will have this tag.                                                          |
